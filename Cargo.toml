# Increases memory consumption but now has smaller load
# than parking-lot until 384 threads instead of 96.
#
# Note that memory consumption is static and
# in the worst case goes to ~32Kib.
more-concurrency = []
# The recommended way of testing loom.
# DO NOT spawn real threads in tests.
# Does nothing without `--cfg loom`.
